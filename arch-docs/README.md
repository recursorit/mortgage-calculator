# Architecture & Docs

This folder contains lightweight architecture notes for maintainers and customer-facing documentation.

## Documents

- [User Guide](./USER_GUIDE.md) – customer documentation (how to use the calculator).

## Notes

- The app supports exporting to CSV and exporting/printing a real PDF.
- HTML `window.print()` flows are intentionally not used; printing is "Print PDF".
