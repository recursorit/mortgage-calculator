# Mortgage Calculator – User Guide

## What this app does

This calculator estimates your mortgage payment and produces an amortization schedule (how your balance changes over time). It also supports modeling **extra payments** and shows how much time/interest you can save.

## Inputs

### Home price

The purchase price of the home.

### Down payment

Choose either:

- **Percent (%)** of the home price, or
- **Amount ($)**

### Loan term

Length of the loan in years (e.g., 30).

### Interest rate (APR %)

Annual percentage rate (APR). The app uses a standard fixed-rate amortization model.

### Start month / year

Sets the first payment month in the schedule.

### Include taxes & costs (optional)

When enabled, the calculator includes monthly estimates for:

- Property tax (annual)
- Home insurance (annual)
- PMI (monthly)
- HOA (monthly)
- Other costs (monthly)

Note: These items do not change the loan amortization (principal/interest), but they do affect your **total monthly payment** and **total out-of-pocket**.

### Extra payments

You can add extra principal payments to reduce interest and pay off faster:

- **Extra monthly** – added every month
- **Extra yearly** – added once per year in a chosen month (starting a chosen year)
- **One-time extra** – a single extra payment in a chosen month/year

## Understanding the results

### Stat cards

You’ll see key numbers like:

- Monthly payment
- Loan amount
- Payoff date
- Interest saved (compared to no extra payments)

If extra payments are set, a callout summarizes how long it will take to pay off the loan and how much interest is saved.

### Cost summary

Shows totals over the payoff period:

- Total to lender
- Total interest
- Taxes & costs (if enabled)
- Total out-of-pocket

### Full schedule

The amortization schedule is grouped by “Loan Year”:

- **Year 1 = the first 12 payments**

Use the “Jump to loan year” dropdown to navigate quickly.

## Exporting

### Export CSV

Creates a `.csv` file you can open in Excel/Google Sheets.

### Export PDF

Generates a formatted PDF report.

### Print PDF

## Tips

- If you want to compare scenarios, adjust extra payments and watch “Interest saved” and “Payoff” change.
- Use “Reset” to return to defaults.
- Your inputs are saved locally in your browser (localStorage) so they persist when you refresh.

## Disclaimer

This calculator provides estimates for planning purposes. Actual loan terms, interest, and payment schedules may vary based on lender policies and rounding.
